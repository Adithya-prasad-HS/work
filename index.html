                    <h2>Python Programming</h2>
                    <p>Python programming examples that cover the concepts, including basic and simple python programs, number programs, string programs, List Programs, series programs, etc. Apart from them, we also included the numpy array and matrix programs, area programs, and the pattern programs. All these Python programs are explained with multiple examples, and we also did the code analysis. Please visit the python tutorial to learn python programming language with practical examples.</p>

                    <h2>Web Design Course</h2>
                    <p>Web design software provides users the tools to create, edit, and update web pages. Web designers will use these programs to create a web page’s layout and content through either editing HTML or a WYSIWYG editor. Companies operating without a website builder tool will require a designer to construct and manage the HTML and CSS framework for their website. These products include features for editing code and visualizing projects. Many will also possess frameworks and templates to assist in creating the website’s basic structure, as well as element libraries with templates or shortcodes to save time during the design process.</p>

                    <h2>Mobile Application Development Programme</h2>
                    <p>Mobile application development is the set of processes and procedures involved in writing software for small, wireless computing devices, such as smartphones and other hand-held devices. Like web application development, mobile application development has its roots in more traditional software development. One critical difference, however, is that mobile apps are often written specifically to take advantage of the unique features of a particular mobile device</p>
